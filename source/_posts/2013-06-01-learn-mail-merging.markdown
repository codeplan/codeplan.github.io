A mail merge program helps you send personalized email messages to multiple contacts in one go. Each message has the same content but some parts of the message can be customized – like you can greet each recipient by their first name.

Who needs Mail Merge? 
If you are organizing a party at your home, you can send personalized email invitations to all your friends with the help of mail merge. A person like Steve Jobs – see the following video – can use mail merge to effortlessly invite his inner circle for the launch of a new product.
